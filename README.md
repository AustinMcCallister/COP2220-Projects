# COP 2220: C Programming

This is a repository of the three main projects created during my Fall 2021 semester Programming 1 class. These projects were simple C programs intended to demonstrate basic programming fundamentals learned during the course of this semester.

# Project 1: Grade Calculator

This project consisted of a simple command-line application which took in a list of floating-point values representing scores for a variety of tests and quizzes, calculated the individual category averages, and finally used those averages along with the given weight values to determine and output the overall grade average.

Skills demonstrated in the completion of this project included:

- Declaring and initializing different types of variables, including ints, doubles, and constants
- Printing formatted text to the terminal, and taking input from the terminal to be stored in variables
- Perfoming simple math calculations in code
- Properly importing standard library header files for use

# Project 2: Amortization Calculator

This project was a command-line loan amortization calculator which collected information including the loan starting principal, interest rate, and payment length in years, and output an amortization table displaying the monthly payment amount and the distribution of that payment into principal versus interest for each pay period. Finally, it displayed the total amount of interest and principal paid, and the total cost of the loan.

Skills demonstrated in the completion of this project included:

- Declaring custom function prototypes and their definitions
- Using control statements and comparison operators
- Utilizing loops, specifically for and while loops
- Implementing basic error-checking for invalid input
- Using comments to describe and clarify functions and code snippets

# Project 3: Text Formatter

This project was designed as a command-line text formatter, which took a string input from the user of any length and presented them with a menu to perform various operations on the text, including returning the total number of characters and words, fixing capitalization and spacing, and replacing punctuation characters.

Skills demonstrated in the completion of this project included:

- C string implementation and manipulation
- Using nested loops to navigate through arrays
- Operating on variables via pass-by-reference
- Utilizing more advanced input methods
- Implementing a persistent menu through a while loop
